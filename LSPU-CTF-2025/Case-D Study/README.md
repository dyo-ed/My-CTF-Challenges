# 💾 CASE-D STUDY: Forensic Analysis

## 🎯 Challenge Goal

To perform a detailed forensic analysis on the file `Case Study.pdf` to uncover hidden information, determine the secrets the student might have embedded, and ultimately extract the flag in the format `lspu{flag here}`.

## 📜 Scenario

It was late one evening at The Terminal, a bustling all-night computer café near campus. You were finishing up a late-night session when you saw a student bolt out the door, clearly stressed, leaving their belongings scattered. Crucially, they left a flash drive plugged into the machine, with a single PDF document open on the screen: `Case Study.pdf`.

The document, titled 'COGNITIVE DECAY IN THE POST-DIGITAL ERA,' was certainly odd. It read like a chaotic, frenetic piece of research, a strange mix of academic concepts and baffling pop-culture references. You quickly saved the file to your personal device, figuring you'd at least recover the student's work.

Your mission is to perform a detailed forensic analysis on this document.
