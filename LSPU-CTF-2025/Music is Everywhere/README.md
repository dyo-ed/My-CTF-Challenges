# 🎵 MUSIC IS EVERYWHERE: Steganography

## 🎯 Challenge Goal

To perform a analysis on the provided audio recording to uncover hidden information. You must determine what secrets the musician has embedded within the sound waves and ultimately extract the flag in the format lspu{flag_here}.

## 📜 Scenario

A dedicated music student spends their evenings practicing the flute, filling their room with soft, echoing melodies. One night, after recording a short performance, they play it back—only to realize that something feels off.

At first, the tune sounds perfectly normal. But the longer they listen, the more it feels like the music is trying to tell them something. It seems as if the notes themselves were carefully arranged to hide a message—one that cannot be heard by ears alone.

The student has turned to you for help to investigate this anomaly.
Can you uncover what the music is hiding?
